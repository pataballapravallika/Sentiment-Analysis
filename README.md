# Sentiment-Analysis
# Overview
This project focuses on classifying restaurant reviews as positive or negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It aims to assist restaurant owners in analyzing customer feedback to improve their services effectively.
# Features
~ Analyze text data to identify sentiment polarity (positive/negative).
~ Use TF-IDF Vectorization to process and transform text data.
~ Employ machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes for classification.
~ Visualize key insights from the data using charts and plots.

# Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/pataballapravallika/sentiment-analysis.git  
cd sentiment-analysis  
Create a virtual environment and activate it:
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac  
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows  
Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt  
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains restaurant reviews labeled as positive or negative. You can add your dataset in the reviews.csv . Ensure it follows the structure:
Review	Sentiment
The food was great!	Positive
Service was terrible.	Negative
# Project Workflow
# 1. Data Preprocessing
Tokenization
Stop-word removal
Stemming/Lemmatization

# 2. Feature Extraction
Transform text data into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.

# 3. Model Building
Train models using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.
Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# 4. Visualization
Visualize the distribution of sentiments.
Show feature importance and other insights.
# Results
# Future Improvements
Incorporate more advanced models like BERT or Transformer-based models.
Expand to multiclass classification (e.g., Neutral, Positive, Negative).
